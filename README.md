Productive Fun series is a series of mentoring sessions with a theme of Artificial Intelligence and its prerequisites. This chapter focuses on the linear algebra applications in Artificial Intelligence.

## Section 1: Matrix Transposition

The *matrix_transposition.py* is implemented in Python as recommended by our mentor. A book that I am reading in this topic is **Linear Algebra** by _Seymour Lipschutz, PhD_ and _Marc Lipson, PhD_.
